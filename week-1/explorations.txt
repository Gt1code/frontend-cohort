While exploring the element contents in the browser’s developer tools, I found it quite interesting to observe how structured yet complex HTML can be. I noticed that many tags were nested inside one another, with some styles written directly within the tags, forming layers that contribute to the overall structure and design of the webpage. On the Evernote website, one particularly interesting discovery was the large number of <script> tags placed under the main HTML structure, likely responsible for the site’s interactive features. I also observed that when I hovered over each element in the developer tools, the browser highlighted the corresponding section on the webpage. This visual feedback made it easier to understand how HTML elements connect to what appears on the screen. Overall, this exploration helped me appreciate how HTML serves as the foundation of every website’s layout and functionality.
