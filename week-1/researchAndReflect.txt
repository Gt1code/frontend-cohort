I regularly use several websites and web applications such as YouTube, GitHub, and MDN Web Docs. Among these, MDN Web Docs stands out to me as one of the most well-designed and effective platforms for learning web technologies. From a user’s perspective, its interface is clean, accessible, and easy to navigate. The use of clear headings, consistent typography, and well-organized documentation helps users find information quickly. MDN also provides interactive examples and code snippets that allow learners to test concepts directly in the browser, making the learning experience more engaging. Additionally, its dark mode and responsive layout make it comfortable to use on different devices and in various environments. What makes MDN especially effective is how it combines accuracy, simplicity, and structure to guide learners from basic to advanced web development topics.

By the end of this cohort, I plan to build a fully responsive E-commerce website for my sister’s hair and cosmetics business. The platform will allow users to browse products, check prices and availability, and place orders for selected items. I aim to design it with an attractive interface, smooth navigation, and strong functionality that reflects modern frontend development practices.

I’m most excited to learn about frontend development, frameworks, animations, and responsive design, as they enable developers to create interactive and visually appealing experiences. However, I’m a bit nervous about debugging complex issues since they require a deeper understanding of what happens under the hood, and debugging isn’t always pleasant for beginners. Still, I’m confident that through consistent learning and practice, I’ll overcome these challenges and grow into a skilled and confident frontend developer.
